<a name="sec1">
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to version 2.7.3 <i>Lite</i> of the GLFW OpenGL framework.  GLFW is
a free, open source, portable framework for OpenGL application development.  In
short, it is a library that constitutes a powerful API for handling operating
system specific tasks, such as opening an OpenGL window, reading keyboard and
mouse input, and more.</p>

<p><em>Please note</em> that this is the <i>Lite</i> version of GLFW, which
means that some areas of functionality present in 2.x mainline versions of GLFW
have been removed.</p>

<a name="sec2">
<h2>2. Compiling GLFW and the example programs</h2>

<p>To compile GLFW and the accompanying example programs, you will need the <a
href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> build system.</p>

<a name="sec3">
<h2>3. Installing GLFW</h2>

<p>A rudimentary installation target is provided for all supported platforms
via the CMake build system.</p>

<p>For Unix-like platforms, the command is:</p>

<p class="pre"><pre>$ make install</pre></p>

<p>Note that you may need to run this command as root or via
<code>sudo(1)</code> in order to install GLFW into the various system
directories.</p>

<p>For Visual C++ and other integrated development environments, an installation
target should appear in the by CMake generated project files.</p>

<a name="sec4">
<h2>4. Using GLFW</h2>

<p>There are two aspects to using GLFW:

<p>
<ol>
  <li>How the GLFW API works</li>
  <li>How to compile programs that use GLFW</li>
</ol>

<p>The first point is covered in the <a href="docs/UsersGuide.pdf">GLFW
Users Guide</a> and the <a href="docs/Reference.pdf">GLFW Reference
Manual</a>, and we suggest that you read at least the Users Guide, since
it's a good introduction to the GLFW API.</p>

<p>Designing and compiling programs that use GLFW is not very difficult.
A few rules for successfully designing GLFW-based programs are presented
in the following sections.</p>

<h3>4.1 Include <code>GL/glfw.h</code></h3>

<p>In your program, you should include <code>GL/glfw.h</code> like this:</p>

<p><pre>#include &lt;GL/glfw.h&gt;</pre></p>

<p>This include file defines all the necessary constants, types and prototypes
that are used to interact with the GLFW API.  It also includes
<code>GL/gl.h</code> and <code>GL/glu.h</code>, and - <em>it defines all the
necessary constants and types that are necessary for OpenGL to work on
different platforms</em>.</p>

<p>For instance, under Windows you are normally required to include
<code>windows.h</code> before you include <code>GL/gl.h</code>.  If you write
such a program, it would not compile under e.g. Linux since
<code>windows.h</code> does not exist under Linux.  <code>GL/glfw.h</code>
takes care of these things for you. Note however that it does not actually
include <code>windows.h</code>, it merely mimics the parts of it that are
needed for <code>GL/gl.h</code> and <code>GL/glu.h</code> (this way we do not
get the thousands of constants, types and prototypes that could otherwise
possibly interfere with our own declarations).</p>

<p>In other words:
<ul>
  <li>Do <em>not</em> include <code>GL/gl.h</code> or <code>GL/glu.h</code>
      (GLFW does it for you)</li>
  <li>Do <em>not</em> include <code>windows.h</code> unless you need
      to write Win32-specific code</li>
  <li>If you <em>do</em> need to include <code>windows.h</code>, do it
      <em>before</em> including <code>GL/glfw.h</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.2 Link with the correct libraries</h3>

<h4>4.2.1 Windows static library</h4>

<p>If you link with the static version of GLFW, it is also necessary to
link with some system libraries that GLFW uses.</p>

<p>When linking a program under Windows that uses the static version of GLFW,
you must also link with the following libraries: <code>opengl32</code>,
<code>user32</code> and <code>kernel32</code>.  Some of these libraries may be
linked with by default by your compiler. In the table below you can see the
minimum required link options for each supported Windows compiler (you may want
to add other libraries as well, such as <code>glu32</code>):</p>

<table>
  <tr class="header">
    <td>Compiler</td>
    <td>Link options</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Borland C++ Builder</td>
    <td><code>glfw.lib opengl32.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cygwin</td>
    <td><i>See Unix static library below</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LCC-Win32</td>
    <td><code>glfw.lib opengl32.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Microsoft Visual C++</td>
    <td><code>glfw.lib opengl32.lib user32.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MinGW32</td>
    <td><code>-lglfw -lopengl32</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OpenWatcom</td>
    <td><code>glfw.lib opengl32.lib user32.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pelles C</td>
    <td><code>glfw.lib opengl32.lib user32.lib kernel32.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h4>4.2.2 Windows DLL</h4>

<p>To compile a program that uses the DLL version of GLFW, you need to define
the <code>GLFW_DLL</code> constant. This can either be done with a compiler switch,
typically by adding <code>-DGLFW_DLL</code> to the list of compiler options. You can
also do it by adding the following line to all your source files that include
<code>glfw.h</code>, <em>before</em> including it:</p>

<p><pre>#define GLFW_DLL</pre></p>

<p>When linking a program under Windows that uses the DLL version of GLFW,
the only library you need to link with for GLFW to work is <code>glfwdll</code>.
In the table below you can see the minimum required link options for each
supported Windows compiler (you may want to add other libraries as well,
such as <code>opengl32</code> and <code>glu32</code>):</p>

<table>
  <tr class="header">
    <td>Compiler</td>
    <td>Link options</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Borland C++ Builder</td>
    <td><code>glfwdll.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cygwin</td>
    <td><code>-lglfwdll</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LCC-Win32</td>
    <td><code>glfwdll.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Microsoft Visual C++</td>
    <td><code>glfwdll.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MinGW32</td>
    <td><code>-lglfwdll</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OpenWatcom</td>
    <td><code>glfwdll.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pelles C</td>
    <td><code>glfwdll.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h4>4.2.3 Unix static library</h4>

<p>GLFW now supports
<a href="http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/wiki/">pkgconfig</a>,
and a libglfw.pc file is generated and installed when you install the library.
For systems that do not provide pkgconfig, you should look in this file for the
proper compile and link flags for your system, as determined by compile.sh at
compile time.</p>

<p>A typical compile and link command line may look like this (using GCC):</p>

<p><pre>gcc `pkg-config --cflags libglfw` -o myprog myprog.c `pkg-config --libs libglfw`</pre></p>

<p>If you use GLU functions in your program then you should also add the
<code>-lGLU</code> flag.


<h4>4.2.5 Mac OS X static library</h4>

<p>When compiling and linking a program under Mac OS X that uses GLFW, you
must also link with the following frameworks: <code>Carbon.framework</code>,
<code>AGL.framework</code> and <code>OpenGL.framework</code>.

<p>If you are using Xcode, you simply add the GLFW library
<code>libglfw.a</code> and these frameworks to your project. If, however, you
are building your program from the command line, there are two methods for
correctly linking your GLFW program.</p>

<p>GLFW now supports <a
href="http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/wiki/">pkgconfig</a>, and a pkgconfig
file named libglfw.pc is generated and installed when you install the library.
You can find pkgconfig in most packaging systems, such as <a
href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a> and <a
href="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/">DarwinPorts</a>, so if you have one
of them installed, simply install pkgconfig.  Once you have pkgconfig available,
the command line for compiling and linking your program is:</p>

<p><pre>gcc `pkg-config --cflags libglfw` -o myprog myprog.c `pkg-config --libs libglfw`</pre></p>

<p>If you do not wish to use pkgconfig, you will need to add the required
frameworks and libraries to your command line using the <code>-l</code> and
<code>-framework</code> switches, i.e.:</p>

<p><pre>gcc -o myprog myprog.c -lglfw -framework Carbon -framework AGL -framework OpenGL</pre></p>

<p>Note that you do not add the .framework extension to a framework when adding
it from the command line.</p>

<p>These frameworks contain all GL and GLU functions, so there is no need to
add additional libraries or frameworks when using GLU functionality. Also note
that even though your machine may have Unix-style GL libraries, they are for
use with the X Window System, and will <em>not</em> work with the Mac OS X
native version of GLFW.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Preliminary native Mac OS X support (via the Carbon interface)</li>
 <li>Preliminary DOS support (DJGPP + Mesa)</li>
 <li>Changed license to the zlib license (almost identical to the previous
     GLFW license), so now GLFW is OSI Certified</li>
 <li>Rewrote the GLFW documentation in LaTeX, meaning several improvements
     (both visual and practical)</li>

     which usually provides better resolution</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Accumulator buffer selection should be more
     robust</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: If stereo rendering is requested, and no stereo pixel
     format could be created, glfwOpenWindow now fails</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: glfwSetWindowSize now sets the size of the client
     area, NOT the entire window, meaning that there is a 1:1 relationship

 <li>[X11] Bugfix: When mouse cursor is hidden, mouse sensitivity is no
     longer degraded</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Source files EOL was PC style (CR/LF) in 2.4.1 (blame
     my WinCVS configuration)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: When a GLFW window is closed, input focus is properly
     released</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Iconification of fullscreen windows should now work

 <li>[X11] Bugfix: GLFW should now compile with Kylix</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.4</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Major source code rearrangement - much code is now shared between
     different platforms, and it should be easier to port GLFW to new
     platforms</li>
 <li>Added a Unicode keyboard text input interface (CharCallback)</li>
 <li>Keyboard key input is now slightly more internationalized: GLFW now
     uses 8-bit ISO-8859-1 encoding for keys representing printable
     characters (e.g. &quot;&Ouml;&quot;, &quot;&#167;&quot;, etc.), as
     opposed to the previous 7-bit US-ASCII encoding</li>

     the task bar icon now disappears properly</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: GLFW should now compile on a wider range of MSVC
     compilers (e.g. .NET) - Thanks Tim Little!</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.3.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Removed the silly limitation of 100 threads (the thread information
     is now kept in a linked list)</li>
 <li>General source cleanup (window state is now kept in a single
     struct, plus some other minor changes)</li>
 <li>[X11] Added Solaris gethrtime() support (not tested yet), which
     should give an improved timer for Sun/Solaris stations</li>
 <li>[X11] Some fixes to the 'compile.sh' script (-O for non-gcc compilers
     and 'make x11-gcc' should now really force GCC)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.3.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>[X11] A minimalist configuration script was added that solves the
     issue with glXGetProcAddressARB, and unifies all Unix/X11 Makefiles
     into one template Makefile (well, one for GLFW, and one for the
     examples)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.3</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added OpenGL stereo rendering support</li>
 <li>Added a function for parsing the OpenGL version string
     (glfwGetGLVersion)</li>
 <li>[x86] Bugfix: Hopefully the CPU core clock dependent timer RDTSC will
     never be used on CPUs with variable core frequencies anymore</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: GLFW could create stereo rendering capable windows,
     even if it was not requested (GLFW 2.2.x did not support selection
     of stereo rendering)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: glfwGetProcAddress returned NULL on most systems (even
     on those that supported glXGetProcAddressARB). Now GLFW assumes that
     glXGetProcAddressARB is supported on all systems, which solves the
     bug, but may result in compiler errors on some systems (please let me
     know if you have any related problems).</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2.3</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Bugfix: Checking for GL_SGIS_generate_mipmap is more robust</li>
 <li>Bugfix: glfwLoadTexture2D will now fail if no window is opened</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Right shift was not detected under Win 9x/ME (it is
     still not as good as under NT/2K/XP, but at least you get right
     shifts)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Visuals are now selected more accurately. For instance,
     glfwOpenWindow will no longer fail if you request a 24-bit color
     buffer if only 16-bit color visuals are available (which means that
     pong3d should work on 16-bit displays).</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Windows did not always get focus (this was a tough
     one!)</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: glfwGetWindowParam did not work with
     GLFW_ACCUM_*_BITS or GLFW_AUX_BUFFERS</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Linux joystick Y axis positions were reversed</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>[X11] Added joystick support for Linux</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added joystick support (only supported under Windows so far)</li>
 <li>Added joystick controls to pong3d.c (only 3 more lines of code)</li>
 <li>Added glfwOpenWindowHint() function</li>
 <li>It is now possible to specify a desired vertical monitor refresh
     rate (for fullscreen windows)</li>
 <li>It is now possible to request an accumulator buffer and auxiliary
     buffers</li>
 <li>Added glfwSetTime() function</li>
 <li>Added a GLFW conversion of the MESA/GLUT gears.c demo to the example
     programs</li>
 <li>[Win32] gdi32.dll and winmm.dll are now loaded dynamically when
     glfwInit() is called. This means that there is no need to link with
     gdi32.lib or winmm.lib when using the static version of GLFW, which
     should make GLFW usage more convenient.</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Greatly improved keyboard input (detect left/right
     CTRL etc)</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: glfwExtensionSupported now detects all WGL extensions
     (e.g. WGL_ARB_pbuffer)</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Mouse cursor was not re-hidden when a GLFW window was
     deselected and then selected again (with ALT+TAB)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Minor bug in the SGI timer - and ugly (unintended) SGI
     timer debug info removed</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: glfwGetDesktopMode and glfwGetVideoModes no longer give
     segmentation faults if no X server is available</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added image and texture loading capabilities (support for the TGA
     file format at the moment)</li>
 <li>Added a new example program (mipmaps.c) for showing off the automatic
     mipmap generation and texture loading capabilities of GLFW 2.1</li>
 <li>Removed the separate TGA loader (tga.c in the examples directory)
     since texture loading is supported natively by GLFW. Also updated the
     Pong3D demo to use GLFW texture loading instead of tga.c.</li>
 <li>Improved keyboard handling (e.g. numeric keypad keys can be
     detected)</li>
 <li>Added a new example program, keytest.c</li>
 <li>Changed the GLFWvidmode structure and the corresponding API functions
     to report pure color bits instead of the confusing (and unportable)
     "BPP" field</li>
 <li>Changed glfwSetWindowSize so that it operates in fullscreen mode
     too</li>
 <li>Added mouse wheel support under Windows (not Win95) and X11</li>
 <li>Added window iconification functions (glfwInconifyWindow and
     glfwRestoreWindow)</li>
 <li>Improved iconification and deactivation handling under both Windows
     and X11</li>
 <li>Made it possible to turn on/off key repeat (the default is now no key
     repeat)</li>
 <li>Added SGI hardware timer support (CLOCK_SGI_CYCLE) for improved
     timer resolution for SGI computers</li>
 <li>Added support for the free Borland C++ Builder 5.x compiler for
     Windows</li>
 <li>Made it possible to compiler GLFW as a Windows DLL using any of the
     supported compilers</li>
 <li>Some constants have changed names (e.g. GLFW_REDBITS is now called
     GLFW_RED_BITS)</li>
 <li>Updated GLFW documentation (GLFW Users Guide and GLFW Reference
     Manual) to reflect the changes in the API</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Corrected Cygwin toplevel makefile entry</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Fixed event lag bug</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Fixed Radeon 8500 crash</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Fixed the window close bug</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Iconification/deactivation is now detected</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Non-OpenGL visuals are not listed anymore</li>
 <li>[XFree86] Bugfix: Undesired video mode changes are now prevented</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.0.3</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added precise CPU cycle based timing support (RDTSC) for x86
     CPUs (under both Windows and Unix)</li>
 <li>Added a makefile option for building for Windows with Cygwin</li>
 <li>Corrected the CC for Unix/X11 makefiles (-Wall is usually not a
     supported flag for CC, so it was removed from the CFLAGS list)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.0.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added a makefile option for building for X11 with 'cc' rather than
     'gcc' (useful for IRIX users for instance).</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Mouse coordinates are now relative to the window
     upper left corner, which also means that disabling the mouse cursor
     in windowed mode should work much better.</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Added a bunch of more keys that are recognized by
     GLFW.</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: glfwGetNumberOfProcessors now works for IRIX (earlier
     versions of GLFW would not compile under IRIX).</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.0.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>glfwTerminate() will now be called automatically upon normal program
     termination (using atexit())</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Buffer-swapping did not work if a window lost
     focus.</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Top level Makefile did not work under Windows
     9x.</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: NULL declaration in glfw.h was not MSVC 7.x
     compatible.</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: GLFW would not build with C++ (e.g. g++).</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.0</h3>
<ul>
 <li>GLFW is no longer a single source file, but an entire link library.</li>
 <li>Added multi threading support.</li>
 <li>Added more window control.</li>
 <li>New distribution layout (both Win32 and X11 version in same archive).</li>
 <li>Added GLFW Users Manual and GLFW Reference Manual as PDF files.</li>
 <li>Some bugfixes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.0.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Improved fullscreen functionality.</li>
 <li>Added fullscreen support for X11.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.0.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added support for the X Window System.</li>
 <li>Fixed bugs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.0.0</h3>
<ul>
 <li>First release.</li>
 <li>Only supported Windows.</li>
</ul>
